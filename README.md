# NumericalAnalysis-Team1.2
UCDenver Numerical Analysis Spring 2017, Project Team 1.2

# Purpose
To write a program, that takes math problems of specific types and solves them.
**Correct Awnser is (45%) of class**
## Types
(list here)

# Output *(25%)*
*   Clear display of the solution (tables and graphs)
*   Errors
*   Iteration count
*   flops (?)
*   accuracy
*   time/effieciency measures

#Important Measures of Usability
##Ease of Use *(8.5%)*
The ease of using the program 
##Robustness *(4.3%)*
Can the software solve entire classes of problems, or just the specific test problems
##Documentation *(13%)*
Oral presentation with handouts, Use of program documentation, Tech support

#Division of labor
*   Programming (and programming documentation)
